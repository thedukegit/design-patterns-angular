Our main concern is calculating the discount (which is different for each tier). We would also like to have special discounts like “black Friday” and “summer sale” discounts.
<br>
These discounts then basically replace the discounts that is associated with a specific Tier, but are still different for each tier.
<br>
So for instance a Black Friday discount for WIP commander will be higher than one for a Basic commander
<h1>vip commander</h1>
10% discount on everything

<h1> Basic commander</h1>
5% discount on everything

<h1> free loader</h1>
no discount on anything

<h1> Black Friday Discount </h1>
15% discount for VIP, 7% for Basic, 2% for free loader
<p>
    <button mat-flat-button (click)="setDiscount('black-friday')">Set Black Friday discount</button>
</p>
<p>
    <button mat-flat-button (click)="setDiscount('')">Reset discount</button>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Awesome skin, only 200</h1>
<button mat-flat-button (click)="calculateSkin(200)">Calculate</button>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<pre>{{ prices | json }}</pre>
